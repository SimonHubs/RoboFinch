# RoboFinch
Official implementation of the RoboFinch, a robotic zebra finch. Find here assembly guides, source code, song and movement files and 3D printing files.

The folder Movement Files contains movement and sound files (and schedules) for 6 different robot programs each deduced from one individual bird.
  movement files are in the txt folder, sound files in the wav folder. for some robot programs we created wavs including the clicking sound of the robots
  
The folder RoboFinch Programs contains all LabVIEW programs to run and controll the RoboFinch. The main program is called 190717-FileSheduledROBOTPres-Ardu-TREATchoice_Prince_ArduinoWait.vi
  the subVis folder contains additional LabVIEW programs on which the main program depends.
  
The file robobird_audioESP32.ino contains the script for the Arduino.

All information necessary to assemble the RoboFinch is given in the Robofinch_assemblage_manual, provided in dutch and english.

The zip folder robofinch_assembly_20190417.stp.zip contains the CAD files necessary to 3D print the RoboFinch parts and also to build the stand for the Robot
